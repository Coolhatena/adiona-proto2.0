# Adiona: Travel with Experience

A 100% digital travel agency with blockchain integration

Frontend made in React/Typescript, including the power of [Gear](https://idea.gear-tech.io/programs?node=wss%3A%2F%2Frpc-node.gear-tech.io) blockchain.

## Getting started

### Install packages:

Use npm to install yarn
```
npm install --global yarn
```
Once Yarn is installed, we can build the dependencies
```
yarn install
```

### Declare environment variables:

Create `.env` file, `.env.example` will let you know what variables are expected.

In order for all features to work as expected, the node and its runtime version should be chosen based on the current `@gear-js/api` version.

To prevent issues with the application, use `REACT_APP_NODE_ADDRESS=wss://rpc-node.gear-tech.io` as environment variable.

We strongly recommend installing the [Polkadot extension](https://polkadot.js.org/extension/) and creating an account to access all the program features.


### Run the app:

```sh
yarn start
```
